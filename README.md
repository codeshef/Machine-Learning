Day 1 :  What is machine learning? 

  You probably use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Each time you do a web search on Google or Bing, that     works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank what pages. When Facebook or Apple's       photo application recognizes your friends in your pictures, that's also machine learning. Each time you read your email 
  and  a spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam, again, that's because your computer has learned to     distinguish spam from non-spam email. So, that's machine learning. There's a science of getting computers to learn without 
  being explicitly programmed.
    
  
 : why is machine learning so prevalent today? 
    
   It turns out that machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of AI, or artificial intelligence. 
   We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program 
   a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how 
   to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam. There 
   was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. So, machine 
   learning was developed as a new capability for computers and today it touches many segments of industry and basic 
   science.
   
   :different types of learning algorithms. There are several different types of learning algorithms. The main two 
     types are what we call supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
    
    In supervised learning, the idea is that we're going to teach the computer how to do something, whereas in 
    unsupervised learning we're going let it learn by itself. 
    
    
    Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives 
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

    Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E 
    with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, 
    as measured by P, improves with experience E."

     Example: playing checkers.

     E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

     T = the task of playing checkers.

     P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

     In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

     Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning
