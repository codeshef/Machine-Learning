Day 1 :  What is machine learning? 

  You probably use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Each time you do a web search on Google or Bing, that       works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank what pages. When Facebook or Apple's         photo application recognizes your friends in your pictures, that's also machine learning. Each time you read your email and     a spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam, again, that's because your computer has learned to           distinguish spam from non-spam email. So, that's machine learning. There's a science of getting computers to learn without 
  being explicitly programmed.
    
  
 : why is machine learning so prevalent today? 
    
   It turns out that machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of AI, or artificial intelligence. 
   We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program 
   a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how 
   to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam. There 
   was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. So, machine 
   learning was developed as a new capability for computers and today it touches many segments of industry and basic 
   science.
